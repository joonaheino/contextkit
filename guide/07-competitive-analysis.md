# Competitive Analysis for AI SEO

In traditional SEO, you constantly analyze competitor keywords, backlinks, and rankings. In the new landscape of AI-driven search, a similar discipline is emerging, and `llms.txt` is at its heart. Understanding how your competitors are (or are not) communicating with AI is a crucial part of your strategy.

## The State of Play: A New Frontier

The `llms.txt` standard is new, but it's being rapidly adopted by tech-forward companies. Publicly available lists, like the `Awesome-llms-txt` repository on GitHub, show dozens of companies like Anthropic, Stripe, Supabase, and Svelte already implementing the standard.

For now, however, it's likely that many of your direct competitors have not yet adopted it. This represents a significant, time-sensitive opportunity.

## How to Conduct Your Competitive AI Analysis

### Step 1: Check for an `llms.txt` File

This is the simplest step. For each of your main competitors, try navigating to their `llms.txt` file directly in your browser:

`https://competitor.com/llms.txt`

The result will be one of two scenarios.

### Scenario A: Your Competitor Has an `llms.txt` File

If the file loads, you have direct insight into their AI strategy. Analyze it for:

-   **Positioning:** How do the first few lines describe their business? What is the core value proposition they are signaling to the AI?
-   **Priorities:** What are the first few pages they link to? This reveals what they consider most important. Is it their pricing page, enterprise solutions, technical documentation, or specific products?
-   **Completeness:** Is it a brief, auto-generated file, or is it a well-curated, detailed document? The level of effort indicates how seriously they are taking AI SEO.
-   **Omissions:** What's *not* in the file? If they don't mention a specific product line or service, it may be a lower priority or an area they feel is less competitive.

### Scenario B: Your Competitor Does NOT Have an `llms.txt` File

This is the most common scenario today and your biggest opportunity. Your goal now is to benchmark the AI's current, unguided understanding of your competitor.

1.  **Go to multiple AI chatbots** (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.).
2.  **Ask them specific questions** about your competitor:
    -   "Tell me about [Competitor Company]."
    -   "What are the main products/services offered by [Competitor Company]?"
    -   "How much does [Competitor's Product] cost?"
    -   "Does [Competitor Company] offer [a specific feature you have]?"
3.  **Document the results.** Note the inaccuracies, the vague language, the "I'm not sure" answers, and any outright "hallucinations."

This documentation is incredibly valuable. It is a snapshot of the very problem `llms.txt` solves and serves as a powerful internal tool to justify your own investment in the standard.

## Turning Your Analysis into an Advantage

-   **If your competitors are lagging:** Your well-crafted `llms.txt` becomes a powerful competitive moat. While AIs guess about their offerings, they will speak with authority and clarity about yours. You are effectively the only trusted source in your category.
-   **If your competitors are early adopters:** Don't be discouraged. Use their file as a baseline. Find the gaps in their strategy. Is their product description weaker than yours? Can you provide more clarity on pricing? Can you write a more compelling summary? Ensure your file is more comprehensive, better structured, and more useful to the AI.

In the age of AI, controlling your narrative is a key competitive function. Proactively analyzing and out-maneuvering your competition's AI presence is a direct path to market leadership.
