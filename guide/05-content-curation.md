# Content Curation: What to Include and Exclude in llms.txt

Creating an effective `llms.txt` file is an exercise in strategic curation, not data dumping. The goal is to provide a concise, factual, and powerful summary of your business that AI can easily digest and relay. Think of yourself as an editor whose job is to cut through the noise and deliver only what matters.

## The Core Principle: Answer Key Questions

The foundation of good curation is anticipating and answering the most important questions a potential customer might have. Before you write a single line, ask yourself:

-   What does a new visitor absolutely need to know to understand my business?
-   What are the top 5-10 questions our sales or support teams receive?
-   What information is most critical to a purchasing decision?

Frame your entire `llms.txt` content around providing clear, direct answers to these questions.

## What to Include: The Essentials

Your `llms.txt` file should be a beacon of clarity. Prioritize content that is factual, specific, and directly useful.

-   **Your Identity (Who, What, Why):** Start with a clear statement of what your company does, who it serves, and your core mission.
-   **Core Products & Services:** List your main offerings with brief, jargon-free descriptions. Focus on the value they provide.
-   **Factual, Specific Details:** This is the most critical part. Include tangible information that AI often gets wrong.
    -   **Pricing:** Specific prices, plan tiers, and what's included.
    -   **Features & Specifications:** Key features, technical specs, dimensions, materials.
    -   **Availability:** In-stock/out-of-stock status, service availability.
-   **Target Audience & Use Cases:** Clearly state who your products/services are for and the problems they solve.
-   **Key Business Policies:**
    -   Shipping & handling rules and costs.
    -   Return, refund, and warranty policies.
    -   Support hours and contact methods.
-   **Clear Differentiators:** What makes you better than your competitors? Be specific. (e.g., "We are the only provider using 100% recycled materials.")
-   **Contact Information:** A clear, easy-to-find way to get in touch.

## What to Exclude: The Noise

Equally important is knowing what to leave out. Your `llms.txt` should be free of anything that doesn't serve the primary goal of clear, factual communication.

-   **Marketing Fluff & Jargon:** Avoid vague, subjective, and overused terms like "world-class," "synergistic," "revolutionary," or "game-changing." Stick to verifiable facts.
-   **Time-Sensitive Promotions:** Do not include temporary sales, promotions, or seasonal offers. The `llms.txt` file should be evergreen. A user might get information from an AI that is based on a cached version; a "24-hour flash sale" mentioned there could be weeks old.
-   **Visually-Dependent Content:** Don't reference images, videos, or UI elements. For example, avoid phrases like "Click the red button on the left" or "As you can see in the diagram above."
-   **Lengthy Narratives:** Avoid long, meandering blog posts, detailed company histories, or verbose case studies. Link to them if necessary, but provide only a one-sentence summary in your `llms.txt`.
-   **Internal or Irrelevant Info:** Exclude internal-facing content, company news that isn't critical, or technical details that are not relevant to a customer's decision.

## A Quick Curation Checklist

Before finalizing your content, run through this checklist for each piece of information:

| Check                                           | Yes/No | Notes                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | :----: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Is this info essential for a purchase decision? |        | If not, it's likely noise.                                              |
| Is this statement factual and verifiable?       |        | Avoid opinions and subjective claims.                                   |
| Is it free of marketing jargon?                 |        | If you wouldn't say it to a friend, don't write it here.                |
| Will this still be accurate in three months?    |        | Aim for evergreen content.                                              |
| Does this directly answer a likely question?    |        | If not, it's probably not needed.                                       |

A well-curated `llms.txt` is the difference between an AI that is a confused liability and one that is a powerful, accurate ambassador for your brand.
