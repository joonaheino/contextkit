## What is llms.txt?

The `llms.txt` standard is revolutionizing how AI understands websites. Created by Jeremy Howard, this specification helps Large Language Models accurately represent your business instead of guessing.

**The Problem**: AI chatbots are becoming the primary way people discover information. When AI can't understand your website properly, it hallucinates details about your products, services, and pricing.

**The Solution**: A strategically crafted `llms.txt` file that feeds AI the truth about your business.
